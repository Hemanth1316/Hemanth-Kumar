GitHub Copilot chat into the project helps workflow by offering debugging tips, and code suggestions right within the development environment.

When coding, it helps to write and refine code snippets. When debugging, it can provide suggestions and detect issues quicker. 

The thing that inspires me is when I'm stuck or need a quick solutionâ€”Copilot chat is right there, making problem-solving smoother and more efficient.


GitHub Copilot chat isn't just standard code editors offer basic syntax highlighting and auto-complete, Copilot chat learns from coding patterns and adapts to suggest relevant my code.
